# Predicting Ad Clicks Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project applies logistic regression to predict whether a user will click on an ad based on various factors such as time spent on the site, age, income, internet usage, and gender. By analyzing the relationship between these features and the target variable, the model helps predict future ad click behavior, which can guide businesses in optimizing their advertising strategies.

## Methods
- Data Exploration: We begin by exploring the dataset with visualizations like histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable, Clicked on Ad.

- Feature Selection: The model uses key features such as Daily Time Spent on Site, Age, Area Income, Daily Internet Usage, and Gender to predict whether a user will click on an ad.

- Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained on the training dataset to learn the relationship between the features and the likelihood of clicking an ad.

- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix to assess the prediction quality for both classes (clicked and not clicked).
